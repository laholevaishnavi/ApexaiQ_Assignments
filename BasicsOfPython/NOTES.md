There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate membe

### 1. List Comprehension
A concise way to create lists using a single line.
syntax: [expression for item in iterable if condition]

```python
[x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

```
### 2. Dictionary Comprehension
 A compact way to create dictionaries.
syntax: {key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable if condition}
```python
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
```
